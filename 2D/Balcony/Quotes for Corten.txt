Hello,

I’m looking to buy some cut 6mm Corten Steel for a balustrade I’m making (or if Corten is too expensive, I’m also considering making it in 6mm mild steel and painting it.)

If you sell it, please can you give me a quote for

130off 980x100x6 pieces
130off 100x100x6 pieces

In Corten Steel, and also in mild steel?

Best Regards,

Daniel
